# AOC 2020
Days 14, 15, 16 and 21 are written in [Pike](https://pike.lysator.liu.se/). Run a program using:
```
$ pike src/14A.pike < input/14
```

The rest are written in pure C. Run a program using:
```
$ clang src/01A.c
$ ./a.out < input/01

$ clang src/01B.c
$ ./a.out < input/01
```

(exception: Day 19 has only one C file and two separate inputs
```
$ clang src/19.c
$ ./a.out < input/19A
$ ./a.out < input/19B
```
)
