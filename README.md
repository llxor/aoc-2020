# AOC 2020
These are my personal solutions to the Advent of Code 2020 problems. Each problem consists of two parts, which are denoted as parts A and B in this repo.

Days (14,15,16,21) are written in [Pike](https://pike.lysator.liu.se/). Run a program using:
```
$ pike src/14A.pike < input/14
```

The rest are written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). Run a program using:
```
$ clang src/01A.c
$ ./a.out < input/01

$ clang src/01B.c
$ ./a.out < input/01
```

(exception: Day 19 has only one C file and two separate inputs
```
$ clang src/19.c
$ ./a.out < input/19A
$ ./a.out < input/19B
```
)
